# Open Accessibility Annotation Kit (OAAK)

OAAK is an accessibility annotation kit which is built for the [open source Penpot App](https://penpot.app/). 

CivicActions has embraced radical openness so wanted to support an innovative new wireframe platform which we hope to use more with our clients. 

Accessibility annotation is useful to ensure that good semantic code is brought into the design phase. This is also important to ensure that designers and developers have clear expectations about the deliverables. 

There are other accessibility annotation kits avaialbe in both Figma and Sketch that have influenced us. We felt that we could add to this library of techniques by adding more help text for designers and a better connection to design systems like the USWDS.
